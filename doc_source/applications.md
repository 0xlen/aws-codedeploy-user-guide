# Working with Applications in AWS CodeDeploy<a name="applications"></a>

After you configure instances, but before you can deploy a revision, you must create an application in AWS CodeDeploy\. An *application* is simply a name or container used by AWS CodeDeploy to ensure the correct revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment\. 

Use the information in the following table for next steps:
