# Create a Deployment with AWS CodeDeploy<a name="deployments-create"></a>

You can use the AWS CodeDeploy console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create a deployment that installs application revisions you have already pushed to Amazon S3 or, if your deployment is to an EC2/On\-Premises compute platform, GitHub, on the instances in a deployment group\.

The process for creating a deployment depends on the compute platform used by your deployment\.
