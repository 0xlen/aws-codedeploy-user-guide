# AWS CodeDeploy Tutorials<a name="tutorials"></a>

This section includes some tutorials to help you learn how to use AWS CodeDeploy\.

If you haven't completed it already, we recommend you start with [Step 5: Try the AWS CodeDeploy Sample Deployment Wizard](getting-started-wizard.md)\. It requires no prior experience with AWS CodeDeploy\. It guides you through the steps required to deploy one of our sample application revisions to Amazon EC2 instances\.

**Important**  
Before you begin, complete the prerequisites in [Getting Started with AWS CodeDeploy](getting-started-codedeploy.md)\. 

The procedures in these tutorials provide suggestions for the location in which to store files \(for example, c:\\temp\) and the names to give to buckets, subfolders, or files \(for example, codedeploydemobucket, HelloWorldApp, and CodeDeployDemo\-EC2\-Trust\.json, respectively\), but you are not required to use them\. Just be sure to substitute your file locations and names as you perform the procedures\.
